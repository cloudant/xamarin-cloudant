# Getting Started with Cloudant Toolkit for Xamarin

The Cloudant Toolkit for Xamarin provides mobile capabilities for storing data in the cloud.

To use Cloudant Toolkit in your Xamarin (iOS or Android) app, just add the Cloudant Toolkit component to your project.

After initialization, you can start using data functions in your app. A good place to start is at [Creating databases](./doc/creating-databases.md).
